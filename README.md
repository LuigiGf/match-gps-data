# CTSA Project

UNIFESP project of the CTSA course (Portuguese acronym for "Science, Technology, Society and Environment"). In this project, a program will be developed that identifies a user's route patterns and compares them with other users patterns, with that, it would be possible to suggest rides automatically. This would decrease the number of vehicles and pollution in a city.
